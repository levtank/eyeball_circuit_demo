Eyeball circuit (sensory coding) demo

Python and Arduino code for an interactive visualisation of sensory coding within the visual system. 

Light-level information is converted to voltage via photocell resistors (the "retina"), which is then converted to neural population coding (visualised neural firing in the "visual cortex"). Neural population visualisation is spatially organised to mirror that of the photocell arrangement (roughly "retinotopically").
